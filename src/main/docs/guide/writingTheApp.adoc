We are writing a Grails Application using the `rest-profile` which connects to two data sources.

NOTE: In previous versions of Grails for multiple data sources a best effort transaction chain was used to attempt to manage a transaction across all configured data sources. As of Grails 3.3 this is disabled as it caused confusion since it isnâ€™t a true XA implementation and also impacts performance as for every transaction you have a transaction for each data source bound regardless if that is the actual requirement.
